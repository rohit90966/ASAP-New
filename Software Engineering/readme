📌 Intelligent Software Project Forecasting and Team Capability Management System
📖 Project Overview

Modern software organizations face challenges in planning projects accurately due to changing requirements, varying team skills, and uncertain risks. Traditional project planning approaches often rely on manual judgment, which can lead to delays, poor team allocation, and unforeseen risks.

This project presents an Intelligent Software Project Forecasting and Team Capability Management System that helps organizations plan software projects more effectively by analyzing employee skills, team capability, project complexity, and historical data.
The system acts as a decision-support platform for project managers to form suitable teams, forecast project timelines, and identify potential risks at an early stage.

🎯 Objectives

To manage employee profiles and their technical skill sets

To form project teams based on skill–requirement matching

To forecast project effort and completion timeline

To predict project risk and schedule slippage probability

To assist project managers in making informed planning decisions

🚀 Key Features
1. Employee & Skill Management

Maintain employee details such as role, experience, skills, and tech stack proficiency

Centralized skill repository for the organization

2. Project Creation & Requirement Definition

Define project type, complexity, requirement size, and preferred technologies

Acts as the base input for forecasting and team formation

3. Skill-Based Team Formation

Automatically suggests suitable team members based on required skills

Assigns roles such as developer, tester, and project lead

Identifies missing skills and potential skill gaps

4. Team Capability Scoring

Calculates a capability score based on team experience, skill relevance, and past performance

Used to improve forecasting accuracy

5. Effort & Timeline Forecasting

Predicts expected development effort (person-days)

Estimates project duration using data-driven models

6. Project Risk Prediction

Predicts overall project risk level (Low / Medium / High)

Considers technical complexity, team capability, and requirement uncertainty

7. Requirement Volatility Indicator

Estimates the likelihood of requirement changes during development

Helps managers plan buffers and reduce scope creep

8. Schedule Slippage Probability

Predicts chances of missing deadlines

Supports better scheduling and dependency planning

9. Project Dashboard & Reports

Visual summary of team composition, forecasts, and risks

Helps management track project readiness
